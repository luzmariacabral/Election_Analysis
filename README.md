## Election-Audit Summary
Among the election analyst the efficiency of this program, Python 3.6.1 and this scrupt proved a time saving tool.  This new script that we've finalized can be used in future elections by changing the variables to account for different distrcting. For example to fit local city elections to big governor statewide elections, with any number of candidates. Also adding loops to get a more detailed summary of the election results. Other uses with modifications would be for the candidates use for polling the population.
